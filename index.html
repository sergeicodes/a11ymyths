          <h2 class="myth__title">Accessibility only affects a small group of users</h2>

          <p>
            Not that small. Around <strong>15%</strong> of the world's population, or estimated
            <strong>1 billion</strong> people, live with disabilities, they are the world's largest minority. The number
            of people with disability is dramatically increasing.

          <h2 class="myth__title">Disabled users don't use my website</h2>

          <p>
            How can you be so sure? Many people with disabilities like color blindness, limited motor skills, etc. use
            websites just like other users. Also, many
            <strong>assistive technologies are not detectable</strong> in any way.

        <section class="myth">
          <h2 class="myth__title">Making a website accessible is costly and time-consuming</h2>

          <p>
            It may not be the case if accessibility is considered from the beginning of the project and a development
            team has proper skills. When accessibility has become a habit, the
            <strong>development time doesn't change</strong> or changes a little.
          </p>

        <section class="myth">
          <h2 class="myth__title">We can quickly add accessibility before the release</h2>

          <p>
            Won't work. Maybe easy things such as alternative text or form labeling may be added at the end, but some
            <strong>complex UX should be planned to be accessible</strong>. In some cases, making features accessible at
            the end of development process may require the full refactoring.

        <section class="myth">
          <h2 class="myth__title">Accessibility is only about adding alternative text to images</h2>

          <p>
            In fact, missing alternative text for images is
            <a target="_blank" href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">one of the biggest accessibility issues</a>.
            But besides this, there are many things to be considered while making accessible website -
            <strong>headline structure</strong>, <strong>functional controls</strong>,
            <strong>color contrast</strong> and much more.

        <section class="myth">
          <h2 class="myth__title">Web accessibility is just a developer's responsibility</h2>
          <p>
            It's a team effort. <strong>Designers</strong> create accessible UIs, <strong>developers</strong> build it,
            <strong>QA engineers</strong> do the accessibility testing, <strong>PMs</strong> make sure that
            accessibility is included in the team processes, <strong>legal team</strong> checks if a product is risk
            free from an accessibility perspective, <strong>content managers</strong> adjust content to be compliant.

          <h2 class="myth__title">Accessibility only helps people with disabilities</h2>

          <p>
            Fortunately <strong>it helps everyone</strong>. It's a known fact that applying accessibility principles
            improves overall user experience and makes a website more convenient to use.

        <section class="myth">
          <h2 class="myth__title">Making websites accessible doesn't bring any additional benefits</h2>

          <p>
            To list just a few of them - more users, more revenue, better reputation, less risks to be sued, better
            competence of development teams and many more. At the end doing
            <strong>a good thing</strong> doesn't always have to require a profitable reason.

        <section class="myth">
          <h2 class="myth__title">Accessibility can be fixed by the accessibility overlay</h2>

          <p>
            Absolutely no. There is an

            signed by hundreds of professionals which advocates the removal of the web accessibility overlay.

          <p>
            That would be easy, but no. Usually automated accessibility testing can only find

          <h2 class="myth__title">Accessibility is only for blind users</h2>

          <p>
            Certainly, accessibility affects the experience of blind users, but it also users with other visual
            disabilities such as color blindness. And of course, it also benefits people with other forms of disability,
            related to hearing, mobility, speech or cognition. It also works for elderly users. In short, for all users.
            It is <strong>essential for some but useful for all</strong>.

          <h2 class="myth__title">Accessibility is only about preventing lawsuits</h2>

          <p>
            Accessibility is about your users. Of course, preventing lawsuits is important for any company, but
            <strong>user satisfaction</strong> and <strong>company reputation</strong> bring a lot of value as well.

            Usually it starts from
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/" target="_blank">WCAG</a>, but in real life a compliant
            website may still not be fully accessible. Accessibility is about understanding the need of all users as
            well as about empathy and awareness.

            is an important part of accessibility, but the golden rule of ARIA is

          <p>
            Maybe you need. There are a number of laws and regulations which may require a website to follow
            accessibility principles. It's definitely worth checking them.

          <p>
            Luckily no. Everyone with some accessibility skills can implement and test websites for accessibility. In
            fact, it's not only easy to learn, but sometimes it's quite a fun process. It doesn't require a specific
            experience to run the

        <section class="myth">
          <h2 class="myth__title">Accessibility is like a feature - you do it once and then you have it</h2>

          <p>
            Accessibility is a practice, not a feature. It means that one should take care of it regularly, both when
            working on features or doing maintenance work. The knowledge about accessibility should be passed on when a
            new team member joins or when requirement changes.

          <h2 class="myth__title">
            Accessibility can be fixed by providing a separate website version for disabled people
          </h2>

          <p>
            That was the wrong assumption back then. Since that time, many development teams have
            <strong>learned the hard way</strong> that maintaining several versions of the website and keeping all the
            content up to date <strong>costs much more</strong> than creating the only one fully accessible website.

            That's wrong. In fact, in some cases internet is
            <strong>the only way</strong> how disabled people can communicate to the world. Also, where "abled people"
            use their natural feelings such as sight and hearing,
            <strong>people with disabilities must rely on technologies</strong>.
