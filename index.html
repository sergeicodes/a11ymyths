            How can you be so sure? Many people with disabilities like color
            blindness, limited motor skills, etc. use websites just like other
            users. Also, many
            <strong>assistive technologies are not detectable</strong> in any
            way.

          <p>
            It may not be the case if accessibility is considered from the
            beginning of the project and a development team has proper skills.
            When accessibility has become a habit, the
            <strong>development time doesn't change</strong> or changes a
            little.

          <p>
            Won't work. Maybe easy things such as alternative text or form
            labeling may be added at the end, but some
            <strong>complex UX should be planned to be accessible</strong>. In
            some cases, making features accessible at the end of development
            process may require the full refactoring.

          <p>
            It's a team effort. <strong>Designers</strong> create accessible
            UIs, <strong>developers</strong> build it,
            <strong>QA engineers</strong> do the accessibility testing,
            <strong>PMs</strong> make sure that accessibility is included in the
            team processes, <strong>legal team</strong> checks if a product is
            risk free from an accessibility perspective,
            <strong>content managers</strong> adjust content to be compliant.

            Fortunately <strong>it helps everyone</strong>. It's a known fact
